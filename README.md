# Programming Challenges

This repository contains **2 programming problems** designed to test your problem-solving skills and coding abilities.

## 📁 Problems

Navigate to each folder to find individual challenges:

1. **[adjacent-bomb-count/](./adjacent-bomb-count/)** - Algorithm and logic problem
2. **[react-chessboard/](./react-chessboard/)** - React component development challenge

## � Setup & Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Git
- GitHub account with @startappss.com domain

### Initial Setup

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your forked repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/programming-challenges.git
cd programming-challenges
```

3. **Choose a problem** and navigate to its folder:

```bash
# For algorithm problem
cd adjacent-bomb-count
npm install
npm test

# OR for React problem  
cd react-chessboard
npm install
npm test
npm start  # to run the app
```

## 📋 Working Instructions

1. **Read the README** in each problem folder carefully
2. **Understand the requirements** before starting
3. **Implement your solution** following the specified guidelines
4. **Test your solution** using the provided test cases
5. **Commit and push your changes**
6. **Create ONE Pull Request** for both problems (see submission section below)

## ⚠️ Important Rules

**NO USE OF AI TOOLS ALLOWED**

This includes but is not limited to:

- ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI assistants
- AI-powered IDEs or code completion beyond basic IntelliSense
- AI code generation tools
- AI debugging assistants

**Use only:**

- Official documentation
- Your own knowledge and skills
- Standard debugging tools
- Non-AI search engines for official docs

## 🤝 Collaboration Guidelines

**Senior Escalation:**
- ⚠️ **Reach out to seniors only if absolutely required**
- 🎯 **Ask specific questions** - Not "how to solve this" but "why does X approach fail"

## 🎯 Goal

These challenges are designed to assess your:

- Problem-solving approach
- Code quality and organization
- Understanding of fundamental concepts
- Debugging skills
- Attention to detail

## 📝 Submission Process

### Single Pull Request for Both Problems

Once you've completed BOTH problems:

1. **Commit your changes for both problems:**

```bash
# From repository root
git add .
git commit -m "Complete both programming challenges

- Implement adjacent bomb count algorithm
- Create interactive React chessboard with performance optimizations"
```

2. **Push to your fork:**

```bash
git push origin main
```

3. **Create Pull Request:**
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub
   - Click "Pull Request" → "New Pull Request"
   - Set base repository to the original repo
   - Add title: `Solution: [Your Name] - Programming Challenges`
   - Use this description template:
